Operational Control with iCub
=============================

# Prerequisites
By now, you should be an expert of the following components :wink::
- [Cartesian Control](http://wiki.icub.org/iCub/main/dox/html/icub_cartesian_interface.html).
- [Gaze Control](http://wiki.icub.org/iCub/main/dox/html/icub_gaze_interface.html).

# Assignment
We want you to develop a rather simple module that employs the `Cartesian Interface`
and the `Gaze Interface` to accomplish the following tasks:

1. Make iCub **look down at the table**.
2. **Detect the blue ball** in both image planes.
3. Retrieve the **ball position** in the Cartesian domain.
4. Ask iCub to reach for the ball and **make it roll**.

## Notes
- To make the blue ball show up within the simulator, you have to turn on the
**objects** flag in the **`iCub_parts_activation.ini`** file.
